# enumerable_ruby
 enumerable implementation in ruby

 >The Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort. The class must provide a method each, which yields successive members of the collection. If  `Enumerable#max`, `#min`, or `#sort` is used, the objects in the collection must also implement a meaningful <=> operator, as these methods rely on an ordering between members of the collection.
